- new file creation:
        need a file browser that selects directories rather than files
        then prompt the user for a name for the file, create it and open it

- ctrl + arrow keys needs improvement, it doesn't seem quite right.

- make tabsize customizable

- when user presses enter, a new line should start at the current indentation level

- somehow making tab a single character (\t) that can be backspaced

- fix finding to make it easier to use and more straight forward, then add replace
    - when the user presses ctrl+f, they can type in a new search string. when
      they press enter the search string will be saved.
    - then the user can move to the next/previous instance of this search string
      by pressing a hot key (not sure what key)
    - once this is done, I should add a replace that works the same way except it replaces
      the next instance of the search string

- auto-complete
    - I believe this is do-able, I could use an urwid pop-up with a small listbox of suggestions

- add line numbers, coudl be done with a seperate listbox next to the main text listbox
    - could be turned on and off by hotkey
