        About
        ---------
        
        First of all, Scum is really just a novelty editor I wrote mostly for
        learning and fun. It was not made to compete with seasoned text editors
        such as Emacs or Vim (hence the name "Scum"). With that being said, it
        is still a fully-functional terminal based editor! It can be used for
        both quick editing and full on development. Overall it was extremely fun
        to write and was a wonderful learning experience. Enjoy! (at your own
        risk)
