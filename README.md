### About
------------
First of all, Scum is really just a novelty editor I wrote mostly for learning and fun. It was not made to compete with
seasoned text editors such as Emacs or Vim (hence the name "Scum"). With that being said, it is still a fully-functional
terminal based editor! It can be used for both quick editing and full on development. Overall it was extremely fun to write
and was a wonderful learning experience. Enjoy! (at your own risk)
